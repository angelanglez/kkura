    <p class="parabody">BuildingBloCS is Singapore’s largest student-led computing advocacy organisation. As an organiser, I have helped to create and design promotional material in order to reach out to the student population, as well as other back-end work to ensure our conferences run smoothly. I also had the opportunity to emcee for our flagship conference in June of 2024 in front of over 200 participants.</p>

    <p class="parabody">During my many years as a member of my school’s Robotics Club, I have been able to foster my passion towards engineering and programming. I had the great opportunity to be the Outreach manager of the EXCO where I was able to put my design skills to use and share our love for robotics to other students. I also had the opportunity to partipate in conducting a robotics workshop for children aged 10-12 in partner with a local youth organisation with the rest of the club. </p>

    <p class="parabody">As I slowly discovered my intrigue towards technology, I had decided to join Infocomm Club in JC in addition to Robotics Club. With Infocomm, I was able to further my knowledge of AI, cybersecurity, as well as other computing related sujects, and was given many opportunities to participate in competitions such as ctfs.</p>
