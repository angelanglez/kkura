    <h3>Hi!</h3>
    <h3>I'm Angelina</h3>
    <h4>I'm a 11th grade student from Singapore with an undying passion for STEM.</h4>
    <p>I especially love chemistry, and I have been dabbling in some robotics and programming for my extra-curriculars. </p>
    <p>I enjoy learning and discovering new things, which has further fueled my journey to improve my hard and soft skills. </p>
