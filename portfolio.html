    <p class="parabody">During my many year as a member of my school’s Robotics Club, I have been able to foster my passion towards engineering and programming. I had the great opportunity to be the Outreach manager of the EXCO where I was able to put my design skills to use and share our enthusiasm to other students. </p>
